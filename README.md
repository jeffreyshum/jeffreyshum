# Hi! I'm Jeffrey Shum

I'm currently a student at Stony Brook University with a double major in Computer Science and Applied Math & Statistics. I'm also a student of the accelerated Masters Program in Computer Science at Stony Brook.

I'm looking to learn more about frontend development through work opportunities to use my skills to learn and grow.
